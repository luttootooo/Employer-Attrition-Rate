# Employer-Attrition-Rate

<br> This project is my first data hackathon during the COVID-19 pandemic held by HackerEarth. This challenge aims to predict the organization's employees' attrition rate as that is one of the considerable costs to assess the employees' performance. This challenge contains many features from age, gender, department, some unknown variable, and so on. I performed a lot of encoding processes because most of the features are categorical. Hence, I didn't use many data science techniques, just standard preprocessing on the dataset.
<br> This challenge used root mean squared error to evaluate our model. After applying many preprocessing methods to the dataset and building the appropriate model, I got the final score of 73.96075 (the top scorer is unknown).
